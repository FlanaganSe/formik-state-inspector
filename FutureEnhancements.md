# Future Enhancements

Production-readiness improvements prioritized by impact and ease of implementation.

## âœ… Recently Completed Improvements

**Security and performance enhancements completed:**
- **Enhanced error handling** - Improved defensive programming and user feedback
- **Performance optimization** - Fast change detection and efficient DOM updates
- **Memory leak prevention** - Better timeout management and cleanup
- **Silent operation** - Reduced console spam for better user experience
- **Copy button feedback** - Visual confirmation with color coding

## ðŸŽ¯ High Impact (Production Polish)

**Items that significantly improve user experience.**

### 4. Simple Demo App
- **What**: `demo/index.html` with basic React + Formik form
- **Why**: Makes development and testing trivial
- **Impact**: Accelerates all future development

### 6. Dark Mode
- **What**: Respect `prefers-color-scheme`
- **Impact**: Essential for developer tools

## ðŸ”§ Developer Experience

**Makes the project easier to maintain and contribute to.**

### 7. Basic Testing
- **Unit tests**: `getFormikBag()` function logic
- **E2E test**: Extension loads and finds forms in demo app
- **Tool**: Jest or Vitest (lightweight)

### 8. Code Quality Setup
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent formatting
- **GitHub Actions**: Auto-lint on PRs
- **Impact**: Easier to review and maintain

### 9. Collapsible JSON Sections
- **What**: Expand/collapse values, errors, touched
- **Why**: Large form objects are hard to read
- **Impact**: Better scalability

## ðŸš€ Future Considerations

**Lower priority items for later versions.**

- TypeScript migration for type safety
- Performance optimization for large React trees
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Chrome Web Store release automation

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Demo app** (1 hour)
2. **Copy feedback** (30 minutes)
3. **Basic testing** (2-3 hours)
4. **Dark mode** (1-2 hours)
